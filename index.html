					Hi everybody ! I am currently in my third year of the BBA programm at the ESSEC Business School. I am looking for an apprenticeship abroad so I will be able to discover new places and new cultures. I've always had a special taste for travels and the experimentation of new expriences to get out of my comfort zone. 
					Working with me and you will see a motivated, dedicated and pleasant person !

				<h2>TRAVELS</h2>

				Whenever I can, I always try to escape from my daily routine to discover new things. I don't need a lot... Give me 3/4 days and I will do the best trip you can ever imagine. I love to meet new people during my experiences because they are the best positioned to make me seeand do things that only locals know.

				<p>Below, you will find a video that one on my friend recorded when we went to Varanasi in India that shows clearly my conception of travel.

				Clothing is sector in which I've always been interested since I was a young teenager. I think that clothing is one of the way to show people who you are and express your personality throught your clothing choices. I strongly believe that clothes tell a story about the things you like and the things that inspire you.

				Below you will find a video of the SS2019 Louis Vuitton's fashion show in Paris. It's one of my favorite because I love the energy that emanates from it and the story behind it.

				Music has always been an important part of my life. My playlist follow me everywhere I go, wether I'm going to work, on holydays or chilling at home. The thing that I search in music isn't a peticular song, It's more an energy I can relate to. I can listen and enjoy all types of music, it just depends on the mood I'm in.
				</p>
				<p>
				Right now, I listen a lot of house and underground music. I am always looking for news artists. Below you will find a Boiler Room DJ SET from Fred Again that I think is one of the best set I've ever seen.
